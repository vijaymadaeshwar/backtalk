"""live.py - real-time facts, fetched before the model is allowed to answer.

A reasoning model asked "what happened today" will sometimes answer from
memory, and a memory answer about the present is just a confident
invention. The fix is to not offer it the choice: when a question can only
be answered from the live web, the fetch happens here, in code, and the
result is handed to the model as context. A fetch costs one or two
seconds, so it is far quicker than letting the model discover a search
tool, deliberate, and spawn subagents.

Everything here is best effort. A failed fetch yields no context and the
question is answered normally, so a flaky network never breaks a turn.
