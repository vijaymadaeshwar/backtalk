"""Spotify ducking (macOS) — music dips while the voice talks.

Relative duck: if Spotify is playing above THRESHOLD, drop it to
max(THRESHOLD, current * PCT) while the assistant speaks; restore after.
Quiet music is left alone. The restore is DEBOUNCED: the mouth goes
momentarily idle between streamed chunks, and bouncing the volume every
gap is seasickness — restore only after sustained silence. Never
launches Spotify; every call no-ops if it isn't running.

On non-macOS platforms every method is a silent no-op (the AppleScript
bridge is the macOS way; PRs for pycaw/playerctl equivalents welcome).
