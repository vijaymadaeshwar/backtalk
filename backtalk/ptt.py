"""Hold-to-talk — a global key listener.

HOLD the key -> mic opens. RELEASE -> mic closes and the utterance is
processed. The button IS the voice-activity detector, which is why this
mode is speaker-safe with no headphones: the mic simply isn't open while
the assistant talks, unless you press the key — and pressing while it
talks interrupts it.

THE KEY-REPEAT TRAP (the bug that kills every naive build): the OS fires
on_press events CONTINUOUSLY while a key is held. Without the held-state
filter below, every repeat reads as a fresh press and keeps cancelling
the reply before it can speak.

AND THE HALF THAT TRAP HIDES: some keyboards send auto-repeat as full
DOWN/UP PAIRS rather than the repeated DOWN-only stream. Filtering the
presses and trusting every release then breaks the OTHER way -- a single
hold is chopped into dozens of ~50ms recordings, each too short to
transcribe, and the whole thing is SILENT. No exception, no log line,
nothing to search for; it simply reads as "the microphone does not work".
Measured in the field on a Logitech MX Mechanical through a Bolt
receiver: one 2.6-second hold produced 186 key events and about fifty
recordings. So a release is never trusted on sight -- see is_held().

macOS needs Input Monitoring permission for the hosting terminal
(System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Input Monitoring). Windows
works out of the box; some Linux desktops need the user in the `input`
group or an X11 session.
