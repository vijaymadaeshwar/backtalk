"""Session log — terminal print + timestamped append to logs/backtalk.log.

Exists because the hardest voice bug ever hit here (the off-by-one
interrupt desync) had to be diagnosed from source, because the session
only printed to a terminal window nobody saved. Every load-bearing line
([you], replies, interrupts, drain/rebuild events, TTS fallbacks) goes
through log() so the next gremlin comes with receipts.

    Windows consoles default to a legacy codepage (cp1252 on a UK/US
    install), so a UTF-8 em-dash arrives as mojibake: the startup banner
    rendered as "[backtalk] up a<TM>" instead of "up --". Fixing the
    banner's own characters would not have been a fix, because the
    agent's REPLIES are printed here too and can contain anything at all.

    errors="replace" on the streams means a character the terminal
    genuinely cannot draw degrades to "?" rather than raising mid
    sentence and taking the voice down. No-ops everywhere but Windows.
