"""Session-end journaling: write down what a voice session actually was.

The agent's memory lives in files that a human curates. That is the right
arrangement -- but it only works if something remembers to write, and until
now nothing did, so memory rotted between sessions.

This module does the narrow, honest half of the job: it records what was
said and writes it down. It does NOT decide what is worth remembering.
Choosing a durable lesson out of a conversation is judgement, and
backtalk has none -- config.py is explicit that the agent's personality
lives in the AGENTS.md of whatever folder agent_dir points at. So this
writes the facts, including a plain transcript, and leaves the meaning to
whoever reads it next.

Summarising costs a model call, so it is optional and bounded: if the brain
is slow or unreachable the entry is still written, just without a summary.
A journal that sometimes skips the summary is useful. A hangup that hangs
on a model call is not.

This writes nothing unless `journal_dir` is configured. Off by default,
because it writes outside backtalk's own directory and that should be a
choice, not a surprise.
