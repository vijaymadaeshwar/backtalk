"""The mouth — streaming sentence-chunked TTS, played through one
long-lived output stream.

Default engine: Kokoro, in-process. Local, free, no server, no API key,
~0.2s to first audio once warm. Optional premium engine: ElevenLabs on
YOUR key — read from the system keychain, never from a file (see
_get_elevenlabs_key) — with Kokoro as the automatic fallback: the voice
degrades instead of going mute if the cloud fails.

Sentences are synthesized one at a time and queued for playback, so the
first sentence is audible while later ones are still rendering. Playback
is cancellable mid-word: set the stop event and the speaker goes silent
within one audio block plus the device buffer (~0.15s).

HARD-WON AUDIO LAW #1 — ONE long-lived OutputStream, reused for every
sentence for the life of the process. A fresh stream per sentence gives
an audible onset blip or a beat of dead air on plenty of audio setups
(USB interfaces, Bluetooth, streaming mixers that latch onto each new
stream late). Proven by A/B test; do not "simplify" this away.

HARD-WON AUDIO LAW #2 — buffer ~0.75s of synthesized audio before a
sentence starts playing, so a slower machine never underruns into
slow-motion garble.

    every backend it builds, because espeak-ng keeps its state in globals
    and the loader refuses the same file twice. Kokoro builds several
    backends, so ONE start leaves several behind.

    On POSIX that cleanup rides a finalizer and usually happens. On
    Windows phonemizer can only register it with atexit, and atexit does
    not run when a process is KILLED rather than exited -- so anything
    stopping the voice line by terminating it, which is most launchers and
    every supervisor, leaks every directory it ever made. Sixty had piled
    up on the machine where this was found, and fifteen were sitting on
    the author's own Mac when it was reviewed: the POSIX path is not as
    reliable as it looks either. The count only ever grows.

    Patching phonemizer where it is installed is not a fix, because the
    launcher runs a dependency sync that would overwrite it. Sweeping at
    our own startup bounds the total at one run's worth instead.

    Two things make deleting from a shared temp folder safe, and only the
    first is ours: the signature above is narrow enough that nothing else
    matches it, and anything we are not permitted to remove raises and is
    skipped. On Windows a loaded library cannot be deleted at all, so a
    live instance is protected by the OS rather than by us noticing it.
    POSIX does not work that way, but a process that has already mapped
    the library keeps it after the unlink, so a running instance is
    unharmed either way.
