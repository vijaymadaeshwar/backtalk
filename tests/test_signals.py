"""The signal bus, isolated: every note the voice line leaves on disk.

signals has no model and no audio behind it -- it is tiny files other
programs watch -- so it can be driven end to end with the paths pointed
at a temp dir. What is checked is the contract a face depends on: the
right file, the right bytes, and the promise that no write ever raises.
